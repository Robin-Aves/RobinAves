Creating a webpage for myself, foremost as a singer but also as a studio musician.

## Progress
At the moment I have just done a wireframe for the landing page, working in Photoshop to edit the images I have taken to use for my website.

* Credits
I have taken my landing page ideas from the BlackPumas webpage.
I have used some code that made the media links land on the right side, then I changed some in the code to make them vertical.
I struggled for hours to try to make it myself but in the end, I copied it and changed it to my likings.
It's made with https://www.squarespace.com/ so I don't know how to credit that but I have put up all the info I have at the moment.

* Plagiarism

$ git commit -m 'starting point' -m 'As I have written in the README I have struggled with making the social links vertical on my desktop and this is as far as I have come. At the time I hadn't looked at the plagiarism information and this is, therefore, my first commit to this project, I have started this a few times now but I never got satisfied so now I have done a wireframe. I will change the image and have borders on the side. the image will be a triangle in the middle, look at the wireframe'
