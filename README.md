# RobinAves

Creating a webpage for myself, foremost as a singer but also as a studio musician.

## Progress
At the moment I have just done a wireframe for the landing page, working in Photoshop to edit the images I have taken to use for my website.
Started to write a strategic plan for my website and my work as a musician.

### USX - Five Planes
Strategy:
* First step is to give the user a look at Robin Aves from an artistic perspective. This step is focused on creating a platform to present Robin Aves.

* Second step is to create a platform for other musicians to buy my service as a singer, have an idea of doing that through SoundBetter which is a sight for selling your talent as a musician. From singer to producer and much more. where I will focus on my voice. 

* Third step is to give an overview of his/my learning process. What am I doing and how, this will probably be a thing that is YouTube focused and not so much on the website itself.


So the website is foremost a presentation of Robin Aves as an artist, my own music is rather rock pop and then I will experiment with covers to show my diversity. From there I will build branches to services as a singer and after that some kind of "teaching" in the sens that I will show my process. The last thing, (teaching) is something that I will wait to do until I start to get some sort of income.

#### Summary:
* Aim:
Build a band/artist website

* Who:


1 Rock audience like foofighters and southern style rock.
My own music is very psychological and philosophical so finding some way to hone into those people interested in self-development.

2 Covers, attract new followers and show my diversity as a singer to potential producers and other musicians that would like to hire me for work through Soundbetter.

## Credits
I have taken my landing page ideas from the BlackPumas webpage.
I have used some code that made the media links land on the right side, then I changed some in the code to make them vertical.
I struggled for hours to try to make it myself but in the end, I copied it and changed it to my likings.
It's made with https://www.squarespace.com/ so I don't know how to credit that but I have put up all the info I have at the moment.

#### Plagiarism

$ git commit -m 'starting point' -m 'As I have written in the README I have struggled with making the social links vertical on my desktop and this is as far as I have come. At the time I hadn't looked at the plagiarism information and this is, therefore, my first commit to this project, I have started this a few times now but I never got satisfied so now I have done a wireframe. I will change the image and have borders on the side. the image will be a triangle in the middle, look at the wireframe
